### FAQ

Q. I want to implement/fix/redesign xxxxx, where is the document?

A. Sorry, there is no document about implementation because this project was maintained by only KHCmaster. If you have any questions, join [Slack(PPDDev Workspace)](https://join.slack.com/t/ppddev/shared_invite/enQtNjg0Mzg4NTY1MjcxLWFkOGUzYmFiYjY1NjA2Yjk1ZWUyOTY2OGJkZTI0NmY0NDNiZGRiODVmMTQ0NThjNjkxMTlmYzIzNTkzZGRhZjg) and ask them.

Q. I want to use songs dir which is in Program Files.

A. You can specify songs dir in `PPD.ini` like below.

```
[songdir]D:\KHC\PPD\songs
```

Q. I want to run PPDSingle.dll without selecting game.

A. Open `PPD(csproj)`, select `Debug` and edit `Command Line Arguments`

```sh
# Launch PPDSingle
-game PPDSingle
```

```sh
# Launch PPDSingle with login
-game PPDSingle -login
```

Q. Cannot launch PPD by "Failed to check assembly. Please re-install PPD by latest PPDInstaller."

A. `install.info` file must be located besides PPD.exe. You can get it from directory you installed PPD by installer. Or just passing any arguments when launch PPD to disable version checks.
